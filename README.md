# War Thunder - Ultimate Test Drive

## Description

I got tired of the War Thunder's standard test drive, I found it to simply be too incomplete to properly give an idea of how well a vehicle can perform. So I built this singleplayer mission (well, "this", technically over 600 missions, but you get what I mean) as some kind of sandbox and to allow for better assessment of a vehicle's performance.

## Features & Drawbacks

```diff
+ All ground units of all nations are on the map, ready to be fired at
+ The ground units of only one nation is shown at all times, but which nation is shown can be changed at any time with a single keybind
+ Toggleable instant reload
+ The ground units' behaviour can be switched between returning fire and staying passive
+ Toggleable automatic respawn of AI units
+ Long and medium-range sniping spots, with ramps for depression tests
+ Toggleable immortality for the player
+ Several planes (with automatic respawn too) of different eras to test out AAs
+ The planes' behaviour can be switched between aggressive and passive
+ French localization
+ All actions (like toggling instant reload) can be done with keybinds
+ Relatively small size considering the amount of missions included
- Much longer loading time (really, even with a SSD, we're talking about a good minute at least)
- Only English and French localization currently (mission names are fully localized though)
- Selecting shells prior to launching the mission is currently not possible
- Only available for owned vehicles
```
